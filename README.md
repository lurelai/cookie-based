# Review
Just 2 things to pay attention:
1 - It's not common to remove session from the database (or other place you are saving your session on server-side)
2 - It's important to have a way to remove the session for database
3 - Always have a time to remove the cookie (or what you're using to save your session on client-side) from the client-side
4 - Always have a time to remove the session from the server-side (looong times)
5 - Don't allow the user sign-up with your session if it have a different user/agent or ip
