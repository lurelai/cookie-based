For now, I will learning everything i can from [backend-road map](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap). Everything that I don't know, I will learn from there d put it in a repo.


# Review
Just 5 things to pay attention:
* It's not common to remove session from the database (or other place you are saving your session on server-side)
* It's important to have a way to remove the session for database
* Always have a time to remove the cookie (or what you're using to save your session on client-side) from the client-side
* Always have a time to remove the session from the server-side (looong times)
* Don't allow the user to sign in with your session if he has a different user/agent or ip


# Next move 
Learn more about ips, I need to learn how to play along with it (I really need to learn docker-compose too)
